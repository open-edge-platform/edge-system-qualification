# Examples Profile Configurations

This directory contains example profiles that are not executed automatically by the default CLI `run` command. Profiles listed here can be run manually by specifying the profile name with the `--profile` option. Use these profiles to test specific configurations or scenarios by triggering them directly.

For profiles that are executed automatically, see the `suites` and `qualifications` folders.
