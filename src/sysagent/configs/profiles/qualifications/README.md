# Qualifications Profile Configurations

This directory contains profiles that are executed with KPI-based validation when running the CLI `run` command. Tests from these profiles pass or fail based on whether they meet the specified KPI criteria. Use these profiles when strict KPI validation is required.

For profiles without KPI validation, see the `suites` folder.
